Welcome to the Marvel Character Collection App!

The Marvel Character Collection App is a Single Page Application (SPA). The frontend was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The frontend will communicate with a backend API built with Ruby on Rails. I designed and built this application for my phase 4 portfolio project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering bootcamp program. This application allows a user to search the Marvel API for characters. The user can add any characters they choose to their character collection. Once added to the collection, the character will be added to the Ruby on Rails API backend. Then the user will have the option to comment on and like or dislike any of the characters in their collection. In order to use the app, the user will need to sign up for an account.

I hope you like the app and have fun discovering the world of Marvel!

Requirements:

This project requires Ruby (version '2.6.1') and Ruby Gems.

Setup:

These are the steps to get the application up and running:

Step 1. Installation

You will need to clone both the frontend and backend repositories. The instructions for the frontend application are listed below.

frontend - https://github.com/grantba/marvel_character_collection_app.git
backend - https://github.com/grantba/marvel_character_collection_api.git

Clone the frontend repository into your developer environment, then run the following commands in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/grantba/marvel_character_collection_app.git
cd marvel_character_collection_app
open index.html

If 'open index.html' gives you an error in your terminal, then from the application, right click on the index.html file and select 'Reveal in Explorer'. This will open your file explorer. From there you can double click on the index.html file and this will open the application in your browser.

Now, you can sign up for an account in order to use the application. Once your account is created, you're all set to browse Marvel characters, add them to your character collection, comment on, and like or dislike characters in your collection.
